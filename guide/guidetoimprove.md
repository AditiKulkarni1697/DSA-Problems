## ‚úÖ Why it feels hard:

1. **You know concepts** but **haven‚Äôt built pattern recognition** yet.
2. You solve problems, but not with a **structured thinking process**.
3. You might be **rushing to code** without fully understanding the problem.
4. You don‚Äôt get **enough timed or spoken practice**, like in interviews.

## üîÅ Step-by-step Plan to Improve

### 1. **Master Problem-Solving Patterns**

Don‚Äôt grind random problems. Instead, focus on mastering patterns:

| Pattern              | Example Topics                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Sliding Window       | Longest Substring Without Repeating |
| Two Pointers         | Pair with Target Sum                |
| Fast & Slow Pointers | Linked List Cycle                   |
| Binary Search        | Search in Rotated Array             |
| Backtracking         | N-Queens, Sudoku                    |
| Greedy               | Activity Selection                  |
| Dynamic Programming  | Knapsack, LIS                       |
| Graphs               | BFS, DFS, Topo Sort                 |

‚úÖ **Action**: Pick one pattern per week and solve 7‚Äì10 varied problems for it.

---

### 2. **Use a Thinking Framework**

Before coding, train your brain to go through these steps:

```
1. Understand the Problem
2. Write down examples (dry run)
3. Think: brute-force approach first
4. Optimize: what slows it down?
5. Choose data structures that help
6. Write pseudocode before real code
```

‚úÖ **Action**: Speak these steps aloud while solving. It builds clarity under pressure.

---

### 3. **Practice in Interview Mode**

Use platforms that simulate real interviews:

* **LeetCode "Interview" section**
* **Pramp** ‚Äì Free peer-to-peer interviews
* **Exercism** ‚Äì Guided DSA learning
* **FrontendExpert / AlgoExpert** ‚Äì If you're okay with paid platforms

‚úÖ **Action**: Do 2 mock interviews per week with a timer + talking aloud.

---

### 4. **After Solving, Review Deeply**

Don‚Äôt move on after solving. Ask yourself:

* Could I solve it differently?
* Can I reduce space or time complexity?
* Can I explain this to a friend or in notes?

‚úÖ **Action**: Maintain a ‚ÄúDSA Learnings‚Äù Notion or Google Doc where you write:

* Problem name
* Key idea
* Time/Space complexity
* What you learned

---

### 5. **Solve Problems Again**

Come back to previously solved problems **after 3 days, 1 week, and 1 month**.

‚úÖ **Action**: Use spaced repetition to train long-term memory.

---

### 6. **Start with Easier Problems, Build Speed**

If medium/hard problems make you freeze, start with easy ones and build a rhythm.

## üìà Weekly Practice Plan (Sample)

| Day | Task                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------ |
| Mon | 2 Easy, 1 Medium problem (1 pattern) |
| Tue | 2 Medium (timed, explain aloud)      |
| Wed | Review all solutions deeply          |
| Thu | 2 Medium, 1 Hard                     |
| Fri | Mock interview (LeetCode / Pramp)    |
| Sat | Pattern notes, revise mistakes       |
| Sun | Rest or revision                     |

## üß† Mindset Shift

* You don‚Äôt need to **know the answer fast**. You need to show **how you approach it**.
* Interviewers look for **clarity and logical reasoning**, not only final answers.
* DSA is like a language. The more you ‚Äúspeak‚Äù it (daily), the more fluent you become.
